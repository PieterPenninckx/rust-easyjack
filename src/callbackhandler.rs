//! This module defines a trait for each of the possible callbacks which may be implemented for
//! interaction with the jack API Note that these callback handlers do not have thread safety
//! marker constraints because the client always takes ownership of the callback Handlers, ensuring
//! that the callbacks will only be called in a thread safe manner
